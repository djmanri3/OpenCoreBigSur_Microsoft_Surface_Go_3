# What do we need?

- USB with a capacity greater than 16gb
- HDD / SSD greater than 35.5gb
- OpenCore Utilities: https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg
- Patience and time :)

# Steps:

- Format your USB to FAT32 and copy the files from this repo (EFI folder)

- Go to OpenCore-x.x.x.x-RELEASE \ Utilities \ macrecovery open cmd and paste the following command: 
./macrecovery.py -b Mac-E43C1C25D4880AD6 -m 00000000000000000 -os latest download

- Create a folder in the root of our USB memory called com.apple.recovery.boot and we will copy the following downloaded files
  * BaseSystem.dmg
  * BaseSystem.chunklist

- Finally we will boot from our USB drive, and we will go to the disk utility and format our hdd / ssd to APFS
